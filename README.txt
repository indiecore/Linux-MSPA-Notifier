Requirements:
python
libnotify which requires gtk
permission to make something executable

Install instructions:
Download the script and unpack it to wherever you please, then give it execute permission

example:
chmod +x MSPA_notifier.py

After this is done if you wish to start it on startup add it to your startup script. 

For ubuntu users this is located in either
System > Preferences > Sessions
or
System > Preferences > Startup Applications

other distros should know where they keep the startup manager and/or how to write your own

You can add other update macros to the Macros folder, they donâ€™t HAVE to be pngs, any image format that libnotify supports should be fine.

To get new messages simply add them to the updateLines.txt folder

usage: MSPA_notifier.py [-h] [-u UPDATE] [-d] [-l] [-t]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u UPDATE, --update UPDATE
                        The time between update checks in seconds default: 300
                        (5 min) can't go below 60 seconds
  -d, --demo            This just pops an update to test the libnotify system
                        is working correctly
  -l, --link            This is to be used to create a quick click icon for
                        going to a saved page see readme
  -t, --timeout         Flag to tell the libnotify bubble to timeout, defaults
                        to never timing out so you don't miss an UPDATE in
                        your sleep

Usage of the -l

As we all may know some systems (such as Ubuntu) are transitioning away from applets. This is unfortunate because my first instinct was to just make an applet. There isn't a cross distro way to do this yet so -l is the solution. -l will simply instruct the script to open your saved MSPA game in a new tab in your default browser and then close. 

For instance I use xubuntu so I made a launcher applet and told it to launch the script with the -l option on. Until I figure out this dbus magic this is the best way to do it. You don't NEED a quick launch, you could just go to the site when you see an update but I like it. The icon in the Icons directory is included for use with the applet launcher
